Libgarmin:
==========

Libgarmin is an open source (GPLv2) for Garmin image format maps.
For more information, please, visit http://libgarmin.sf.net.
or email libgarmin@gmail.com.

Motivation:
===========
Garmin is a leader in the gps navigation, so learn from
the best. Open source community is moving towards 
www.openstreetmap.org data. Understanding Garmin's format
will allow creation of Garmin compatible maps from OSM data
and creation/design of a new map format for OSM data.

Installation:
============
If you are building a svn checkout. First run ./autosh.sh
then ./configure. You may want to check available options.
Compiling is stright forward - make and make install.

Usage:
======
This library, as other open source Garmin format support projects,
is based on top of public documents and reverse engeneering.
Currently there are two main types of maps - original Garmin maps
and cgpsmapper compiled. Garmin maps do not allow reverse engeneering
and usage with other software than Garmin's. There are a lot of free
cgpsmapper maps that can be used. Check your map license and your 
local country laws before using.
